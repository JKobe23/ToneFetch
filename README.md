# ToneFetch
ToneFetch is an online music streaming app built using Android Studio and Firebase by Jad Koubaissi :) 
App logo created by myself.

Accessing the app is direct, after cloning and running on Android Studio:
1) A registration page will be displayed, along with a register text at the bottom displaying "Register here"
2) Click this text to be directed to the registration page, and then enter username and password to sign up and access the songs
3) Welcome to ToneFetch! Start playing any song and try out the shuffle, replay and play next/previous buttons.

You can use your newly created user and pass to test the login functionality of the app
